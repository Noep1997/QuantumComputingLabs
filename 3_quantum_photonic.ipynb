This is because the expectation is proportional to the energy of the system (since it tells us the number of photons), and therefore while the expectation of Hamiltonian1 gives us the total energy of the system (photons energy + vacuum state energy), the $\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\hat{a}$ operator only gives us the photons energy.

These operators mathematically describe the emission and absorption of photons, respectively. Also, you have seen that any photonic state can be written in terms of the creation operator acting on the vacuum state some number of times. A change in the state of a photon can therefore be described by a change in the creation operator. A quantum computer in principle works by storing information in states and computing by performing various unitary transformations and measurements on those states. We can model those again by using creation and anihilation operators. In this exercise, we will look at a few single-qubit tranformations which are essential for linear optical quantum computing.
